# Excursion Project - Codecademy Project

In this project, I was tasked with creating a web page which advertises a product called “Excursion.” The project required basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, Command Line Interface, Git, and GitHub.

The web page advertises a mobile app which helps users record and share their experiences, includes the use of video and landscape imagery to set the scene. A landing page is a vital tool in marketing a product these days, and the goal with this project was to entice potential customers into using the product.
